MultiDimensional Array Library --> Numpy

Numpy Arrays --> Very fast
  -   as they are Fixed Type
      Like elements in list have many bits associated with it describing its size,
      type, value, etc. Whereas one element in a Numpy Array depends on the type
      --> int or string or etc...
  -   Faster to read less bytes of memory
  -   No type checking when iterating through objects
  -   Uses Contiguous memory (List elements are scattered around)
        - SIMD Vector Processing
        - Effective Cache Utilisation (Keeping everything closer in cache for fast access)


* We Can perform all functions done in lists plus many more

Application of NumPy:
- Mathematics
- Plotting (Matplotlib)
- Backend (Pandas, Connect 4, etc)
- Machine Learning
